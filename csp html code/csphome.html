            <p style="font-size:17px;line-height: 1.5;margin-bottom: 30px;margin-left:1%;">Traditional healthcare methods in India, such as Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani, are deeply rooted 
            in ancient texts and cultural practices. Ayurveda, for instance, emphasizes balance between mind, 
            body, and spirit through herbs, diet, yoga, and meditation. Siddha medicine utilizes herbs, minerals, 
            and meditation for holistic healing. Unani medicine integrates Greek, Arabic, and Persian traditions, 
            focusing on maintaining balance in bodily humors. These methods prioritize prevention and natural 
            remedies, often complementing modern healthcare practices. Despite challenges like standardization 
            and access, they remain integral to India's healthcare landscape, with efforts underway to preserve, 
            promote, and integrate them into mainstream healthcare systems.</p>
            <h2>Ayurvedic Medicine Safe?</h2>
            <p>Some Ayurvedic preparations may contain lead, mercury, or arsenic in amounts that can be toxic.</p>
            <h2>Ayurvedic Medicine Effective?</h2>
            <p>A few studies suggest that Ayurvedic preparations may reduce pain and increase function in people with osteoarthritis and help manage symptoms in people with type 2 diabetes,<br>
             but most of these trials are small or not well-designed. There is little scientific evidence on Ayurveda’s value for other health issues.</p>
             <h2>Ayurvedic Medicine?</h2>
             <p>The ancient Indian medical system, also known as Ayurveda, is based on ancient writings that rely on a “natural” and holistic approach to physical and mental health.
                <br>Ayurvedic medicine is one of the world’s oldest medical systems and remains one of India’s traditional health care systems.
                <br>Ayurvedic treatment combines products (mainly derived from plants, but may also include animal, metal, and mineral), diet, exercise, and lifestyle.</p>
