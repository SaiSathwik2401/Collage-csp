                Ayurveda is from the Sanskrit word meaning “science of life. ” According to Ayurveda everything in life is interdependent.
                Thus, general health and wellness depend on balance and harmony. If one is imbalanced or stressed he/she will be prone to contracting a disease.
                Ayurveda aims at making modifications and using safe methods of natural treatments, therapies and remedies in order to restore perfect harmony of your body, mind, spirit and environment.
                 “Traditional treatment systems like TCM and Ayurveda hold that every person possesses energy, “states Dr. Lin.
                 “Chinese medicine labels this energy system chi while Ayurveda refers to the same as prana. ”It is obtained through proper nutrition, adequate sleep, exercise, and proper stress regulation. 
                If desired, other treatments like botanicals, exercise, activities to enhance awareness, and others may help as well. 
                It means that every person is different and Ayurveda identified individual’s particular type of body, or prakriti. Based on Ayurveda, these prakriti define one’s physical, psychological, 
                behavioral and immunological characteristics. Everyone’s body is unique, and as such, what may help the one person might not help another person with a different constitution.
